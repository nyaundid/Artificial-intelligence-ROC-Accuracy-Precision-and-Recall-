The dataset on the Blackboard contains various measurements (i.e. size, center, etc) from thousands of bacterium under microscope. The last column with non-zero values indicate the bacterium are interesting enough for further study. Otherwise (i.e. last column with zero values), those bacterium are not interesting candidates for further study. Convert this dependent variable to binary values. 

Write a program using either MatLab or any programming language of your choice to perform a classification analysis on this dataset using the neural network approach. 

What is the accuracy, Precision, and Recall for each class prediction? Create an ROC curve plot for each class prediction.
